# The Mentoring Process

The mentoring process is all about getting down and dirty in another person's (professional) life. Your goal is to guide them to being a better person/professional/programmer. Below is a process that can facilitate that.

## Discovery

Get to know your mentee. How are they doing? What areas are they excelling and struggling in? What assumptions have they made (either correct or incorrect)? How do they think about things? What kind of attitudes do they have? It also involves getting to know how others view your mentee. Is there friction between them and their co-workers? Do they get along with their coworkers? Do their coworkers think they are lacking in any particular area? This step can be though of as opening the Windows of Information (below). Remember to Fish For Your Own Information (below).

## Thought

Take the information you now know and look for areas that your mentee can improve in. Try to find concrete courses of action they can do. Giving them general guidelines like "put yourself in the customer's place" aren't useful. A conversation about different scenarios where that guideline could be applied is more helpful. A concrete goal of "next time you implement a feature, try to imagine a customer using it. What are their goals." is better. This step relies on the experiance and wisdom of the mentor to understand what the mentee is going through. The mentee might be totally unaware there's an area they need to work on. THe first step on the Spectrum of Competency is Unconscious Incompetence.

## Prompting

The Prompting step involves communicating with your mentee about the things you thought of in the Thought step. 

> Side Note: Why are you mentoring? Because it's good on your resume? Because the company will pay for shared lunches? Because your boss suggested it? Because you enjoy teaching? Because you want your mentee to succeed? Because you care about their struggles? What makes you care about them enough to spend all this time helping them improve? Some reasons are more self serving than others. If your mentee can see that you care about them, and that you're being their mentor out of that care instead of being their mentor because it makes you look good, they'll be much more receptive to where you want to lead them.

This step might involve criticizing your mentee in some way as you show them where they can improve. Depending on how your mentee handles criticism, this can be very confrontational. It's your job as the mentor to try and avoid this. Refer to Criticism As Information (below). It might be a good idea to talk with them about how to handle criticism.

Ideally, at the end of this step your mentee has made commitments to the concrete goals you thought of in the Thought step.

## Accountability

The Accountability step involves holding your mentee accountable to the commitments they made in the Prompting step. Intentionally check in with them at appropriate intervals, which are probably more than once a month. Perhaps they've made abysmal progress on their goals. Don't judge them, but hold them accountable for what they've done. Ask them why they think it's not going well etc. If they're having no success it might prompt you go to back to the thought step and wonder why it's going so wrong. If they're making great progress remember to verbally reinforce that. A "good job" goes a long. It might be the first positive reinforcement they've heard on the job.

## Spectrum of Competency

[Wikipedia has a great description.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)

## Windows of Information

[Johari Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window)

There are 4 areas of information about someone:

* What they believe about themselves.
* What others believe about them.
* What they think others believe about them.
* What is true about them.

It can be hard to get an accurate picture of how you're doing. A poor picture can lead to imposter syndrome or an inflated idea of your ability. 360 reviews can help, but one of the best ways to learn how someone sees you is to go for coffee with them and ask.

## Criticism As Information

People can base their self worth, identity, or confidence on various aspects of themselves. If people criticize those aspects it can feel like they're being attacked which leads to defensiveness. If that seems to be the case with your mentee then that's an area they need mentoring in. Ideally they can arrive at a place where they view criticism as information, which can be acted upon. Perhaps they need to base their worth in something less fail-able than a single area they're struggling with. 

## Fishing For Your Own Information

Possible scenario: A coworker tells you something about your mentee. (The mentee failed to finish a deliverable.) You go tell your mentee what you just heard. (What happened with the failed deliverable?) Your mentee gets upset because what you heard isn't accurate, and that people are talking about them negatively. (The project was deprioritized by management weeks ago, and then finally scrapped.) Instead it would have been better to fish for your own information. (What ended up happening with that deliverable?)
