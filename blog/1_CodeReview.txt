Code Reviews

I recently had a friend ask me why code review are worth doing. I thought for a monent and realized that there are too many reasons to fit them all in a short concise answer. Therefore, blog post.

Code review offers a chance for fresh eyes to look over a change. When the writer is in the middle of creating a change they often have a lot of state stored in their head. Things like variable names and what the neighbouring functions do. This creates a heavy cognitive load. It's harder to see the big picture when you're so focused on the details. A code reviewer is able to look at a change and ignore all the details that don't matter. They can focus more on the broad picture.

Code reviews apply social pressure to the writer. Want to not let the reviewer see bad code.

The writer has a safety net they can rely on, which might make them less "vigil".
The code reviewer is often looking at a diff of the change. That's great for catching the errors in what was added, but not in what's missing. Perhaps a certain function needs to be called, but isn't. Unless the code reviewer is very familiar with the code the change is made in, it's easy for them to miss things like that.
